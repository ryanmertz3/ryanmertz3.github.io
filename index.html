      <h5>PROFILE LINKS ARE AT THE BOTTOM<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Hello,<br /><br />Welcome to my personal website!<br /><br /> My name is Ryan, and I am an enthusiastic software developer who recently entered the world of technology. Just a couple of months ago, I was immersed in the daily operations of a small aviation equipment manufacturer, where my curiosity for task automation kickstarted an unexpected journey with loads of personal growth.<br /><br />Researching how I could automate our database inputs quickly turned in to applying for the position with 'DPI' and enrolled in a tech prep course. Thanks to the opportunity at Discovery Partners Institute, where I took a leap of faith, I quit my job and dove head first into the programming world. With no prior coding experience, I started learning: Ruby / HTML / CSS / Domain Modeling / Rails / SQL. Before long, I was a software development apprentice. I have been fortunate enough to attend lectures by distinguished professors and receive mentorship from industry leaders and alumni of the most elite universities. It has truly been a humbling experience packed full of lifelong lessons. One of those lessons being:<br />Skills are worthless if others don't know about them. You can't wait for someone to ask if you're capable, because they will never come. Display your work even if it's not "ready," and tell coworkers about your goals and progression. Otherwise, you may as well not have any at all.<br /><br /><br />Having said that, here is the culmination of the last 5 weeks of my life, and a testament to the pace we're learning here. From not knowing what repository or command line was, to this!<br /><br />One assignment we had was to make a website; this website, a central hub for all of our projects, and anything digital we want to show off. After multiple overly ambitious attempts, I rescoped the project and built this website using nothing more than GitHub. While it's far from perfect, I take pride in having written every line of code myself, without using any templates or copy-pasting.<br /><br />Initially, I was overwhelmed by the number of services and programs (jekyll, github, gitlab, gitpod, docker, codepen, dillinger, etc) that all seemingly achieved the same thing - at least from my perspective at the time - they took my files and assembled them into a website. Of course, I was wrong, but I didn't know why. Unfortunately for me, I like to learn things the hard way.<br /><br />The purpose behind each service, how they all worked together, why one service couldn't just do it all, and why they were necessary (or at least made a programmer's life much easier) was too broad a question for anyone to answer, because it would take an entire week to answer to my satisfaction. So, I decided to take a step back and start with the most basic setup, experiencing all these problems firsthand. Armed with just a text document and no internet connection, I began creating this site. Constantly reloading a single html file from my desktop and on to Chrome. Over and over again.<br /><br />Identifying the root of the issue has always been my approach to problem-solving and learning, and this experience was no exception. Lacking the necessary tools, I quickly understood the reason for each service's existence and the problems they addressed. This approach has not only given me a deeper appreciation for each piece of tech but also taught me to use each one more effectively. Understanding "why" has been a central theme throughout this program, both in terms of software and personal growth. Once I can comprehend "why," something occurs at the deepest level, everything else is merely background noise.<br /><br />Whether it's structuring a database, identifying my own personal motivations, or deciding between a proc vs. lambda, I ask myself "why" enough times and eventually land on the same fundamental ideas. Most of Ruby's rules are rooted in Algebra and Calculus theorems - the same ones I never thought would be applied outside the classroom. (Yes, these concepts apply to pretty much everything in existence if you try hard enough, but it's much more obvious when everything gets labeled and quantified in a database)<br /><br />**I have documented my obstacles and insightful 'Aha' moments in my blog, which I invite you to explore (though it is currently a work in progress).**<br /><br />My formal education is mainly in mathematics, although my degrees are Management Information Systems and Industrial Management; Mathematics is where I always excelled and the knowledge I've retained the most. Simply because I enjoy it; I was the only student taking Linear Algebra as an elective and not required for my curriculum.<br /><br />Either way, my foundation in maths has provided immense amounts of clarity around a lot of Ruby's fundamental concepts (I assume other languages, too, but Ruby is my first). As well as the confidence to learn other languages in the future and adapt to new working environments. I am eager to continue learning and growing in this constantly evolving field and look forward to the challenge. Adapting swiftly is more crucial than ever thanks to recent advancements in AI, and I plan to be right at the heart of it.<br /><br />Feel free to explore my website, and if you have any questions, don't hesitate to reach out. I have linked a few of the services I've used, as well as my social profiles below, if you want to connect with me. I am always on the lookout for new projects to participate in!</h5><br /><br />
